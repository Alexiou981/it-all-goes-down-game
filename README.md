# IT ALL GOES DOWN ADVENTURE GAME

It All Goes Down is a command-line based adventure game that allows the user to choose which turn of events the story will take, depending on the decisions made when asked at various points throughout the story. The game runs on Heroku at the mock Terminal created by Code Institute.

## **Mockup**
- The planning before writing any code had been done using [Lucidcharts](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=_chart_en_tier1_mixed_search_brand_exact_&km_CPC_CampaignId=1490375427&km_CPC_AdGroupID=55688909257&km_CPC_Keyword=lucidchart&km_CPC_MatchType=e&km_CPC_ExtensionID=&km_CPC_Network=g&km_CPC_AdPosition=&km_CPC_Creative=354596043016&km_CPC_TargetID=kwd-33511936169&km_CPC_Country=9046553&km_CPC_Device=c&km_CPC_placement=&km_CPC_target=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAuNGuBhAkEiwAGId4ak_DnJqkIQGh8_5ODViJ07z6jzUZbNnUYZEso-G56pdgrzHKGAynIRoCfnsQAvD_BwE).
